Seenng two different versions helps me found where I messed up with my code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It can help me summarize the changes I hve made to a particular file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
In manual commit, you might forget to commit, an in automatic comitting you dont have control over what you want to comit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Both have different uses, one is made for document handling and other is made for code handling spanning across multile files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use it to see and compare the changes I have made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I will have  abckup in case it doesnot works out.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use git to manage my projects.
